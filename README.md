## Description 
Scalpel is an E-Commerce website that allows consumers to rent or purchase high ticket items. Our motivation for creating this project was to give consumers the option to try a highly priced item out before they spend their hard earned cash on it. During the creation of this project we got more familiar with sequelize and routes along with nodeMailer.

## Installation
In order to install this website one must first download the Scalpel Repo. After the repo is installed one must source their database and then seed it. After the database has been seeded, you simply run npm start for the application to run on local host.

## Usage

Scalpel is really user friendly. Once you are on the page, you simply sign in or create an account then get to shopping!

## Creation
In order to create this project, we first started out with creating a basic html and css structure for all of our pages. After that was finished we started turning all the HTML into handlebars so we could make all of the content dynamic. While we were creating the handlebars, we started creating the routes and models for each page. After the routes and relationships were made, we began implementing nodeMailer.
